            Love, I know you've been going through so much lately. I know it's tiring and exhausting<br />
            to deal with everything, Especialy on your own. But you got this okay, you're strong and <br />
            I know it hurts to be strong but you can do this okay. I'm always proud of you in everything<br />
            you do. It's okay to be vulnerable sometimes and it's okay to cry too. It doesn't make you weak<br />
            It makes you human. You can get through this na, I'll be right by ur side whenever u need me<br />
            P.S: Sometimes I wish I could do more or atleast be there to comfort you.T^T
